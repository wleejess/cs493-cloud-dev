    <p>
      This REST API models a review site for businesses. There are two types of resources: businesses, and reviews.
      The web app is designed based on the following design specifications:
      <ul>
        <li>Cloud Datastore is used to store data. The entities are Businesses, and Reviews.</li>
        <li>Functionality includes: Creating a business/review, retrieving a business/review, editing a business/review,
          deleting a business/review, listing all businesses/reviews for an owner/user, and listing all businesses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      You can use URLs and HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations. There is no UI element implemented, but the APIs work!
